# climate stories
Make a proposal and get funding to tell positive stories of citizens that regen the world

## Goals
- Put the spotlight on great projects that are raising money on Gitcoin as part of [the climate round](https://dao.allforclimate.earth/gr14)
- Report on the progress of those projects
- Surface key learnings that can be useful for other projects
- Surface the different ways the community can contribute to those projects
- Help us imagine a better future

## Target audience
This is for all storytellers that want to share positive stories on what people do to address the climate emergency.
You can be a collective or an individual writer, podcaster, facilitator of Twitter Spaces (or zoom, twitch, discord, ...).
There is no limit.

## Process
We invite you to [create an issue](https://github.com/allforclimate/climatestories/issues/new) with your proposal.
We will then create bounties on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/how/funder) to fund you (and we invite anyone to do the same).

## Rules and constrains
- You share the [mission of Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/mission) and the [values and principles of All for Climate](https://dao.allforclimate.earth/values).

## Notes
- While we only have funding at the moment for bounties on stories related to [GR14](https://dao.allforclimate.earth/gr14), we invite you to make proposals about any great story that you think deserves to be shared. Surprise us.
